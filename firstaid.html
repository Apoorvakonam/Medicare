	<p>MedicineNet is an online, healthcare media publishing company. We provide easy-to-read, in-depth, authoritative medical information for consumers via a robust, user-friendly, interactive website.

Founded in 1996, MedicineNet.com is a nationally-recognized, doctor-produced network consisting of more than 70 U.S. board-certified physicians. MedicineNet.com is a trusted source for online health and medical information. The doctors of MedicineNet are also proud to author Webster's New World Medical Dictionary First, Second, and Third Editions ISBN-10: 0470189282.

WebMD acquired MedicineNet in 2004. Since that time MedicineNet has continued to operate with the original vision of fulfilling the integral role of educator, with its own peer-reviewed editorial policy and physicians.

MedicineNet, Inc.'s corporate office is in New York City. Please reference www.webmd.com for corporate information. For ad sales inquiries contact adsalesinquiries@webmd.net.
